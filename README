#sudoku-lib

A library providing the main sudoku game operations.

Add a frontend UI to implement the game. Under gtk3/ is an example of frontend.

The library implements a solver and generator and an undo/redo stack of operations.
It gives a difficulty level for each game, from 1-easy to 4-difficult, and provides tools to operate on a game.
Among the tools are operations such as filling a square with candidates, hinting about a next step, solving the next step, checking if a solution exists from the current state and showing the solution.

The undo/redo stack is associated with a bookmark stack that allows undoing quickly to the previous bookmark, in case it is necessary to guess and try.

It is possible to save a game and resume it later, to get a new random game or to pick a specific game number.
It is also possible to create a new game manually by entering symbols in a grid. The library indicates when the current grid has no solution, more than one solution, or exactly one solution, allowing the user to commit the grid as a new game.

The sudoku solver and sudoku generator are using an efficient implementation of Knuth's dancing links version of the exact cover algorithm (DLX).

By default, make generates the libary and the gtk3 example of frontend, as ./sudoku.
Documentation, based on sudoku.h, is generated by typing make doc.
